# Malware Detection ( Malimg Dataset )
*Identifing malware families/classes*

A Malware is a generic term that describes any malicious code or program that can be harmful to systems.

In this notebook, I have decided to focus on an interesting malware classification method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This idea directly comes from the paper Malware Images: Visualization and Automatic Classification from L. Nataraj, S. Karthikeyan, G. Jacob, and B. S. Manjunath.

Malimg dataset was first introduced by Lakshmanan Nataraj. They were the first to convert malware binaries into images.malware binaries into images. They observed some specific patterns in the images. Malimg is composed of 9339 images and samples belonging to 25 families/classes.
no preprocessing to be applied to the analysis based on the image.
